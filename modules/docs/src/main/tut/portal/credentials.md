## Credentials
In order to use [tooling](/tools) to access VinylDNS, all users must download their credentials from the VinylDNS portal. The credentials are located in the User Menu in the top right corner of the site after login.

### Regenerate Credentials
If your credentials are compromised you can generate new ones. In the User Menu select *Regenerate Credentials*. Regenerating your credentials will invalidate your previous credentials. You can then select *Download Credentials* if you plan to use them with any of the VinylDNS tools.
